## Can't hide that your website uses Svelte

Classes like `svelte-*`, `s-*` can be removed but that's it!

Can't hide/remove/rename:

- Elements `id="svelte-announcer"`.
- Attributes like `data-sveltekit-preload-data`.

## Remote functions

Not officially out yet, but currently they are a buggy mess.
