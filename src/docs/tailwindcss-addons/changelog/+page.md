## 1.1.0

-   Fixed: `SyntaxError: Identifier 'plugin' has already been declared`.

## 1.0.0

If you used the older versions, please look at the documentation to find out what's new. I got rid of the list of changes because there were a lot of mistakes in it. So, we're starting fresh. I'm sorry about that!
